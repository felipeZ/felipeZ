## About me

My name is Felipe Zapata and I work as a software engineer at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). I am a curious scientific-minded software developer with a strong conviction that perseverance, teamwork, and a considerable amount of luck 🍀 are the ingredients behind successful projects. BTW, I happen to have a Ph.D. in computational chemistry, during which I spent most of the time coding things like [Haskell ab initio](https://github.com/felipeZ/Haskell-abinitio) instead of reading papers. 

I am also a polyglot programmer: Python, Rust, C++, Haskell and if you pay me a lot Fortran.

### What do I stand for?
> **I firmly believe that intelligence is just a robust methodology to recursively improve my stupidity**

I have worked quite hard to stand where I am today but this would have not been possible if I had not been in the right place at right moment, supported by a long list of extremely kind people.

I also believe that innovative ideas, like the ones developed by scientific researchers and entrepreneurs, are very difficult to carry out, but these ideas are the ones that have the largest potential payoff for society. Therefore, I work on projects that even though they may not be the most popular or glamorous, give me a long-term satisfaction. 


## At work
🛠 At the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) I have a lot of freedom to create and support the software necessary to drive forward
the ideas of our scientific stakeholders. These are some of the projects that I am currently working on:
* [Votca](https://github.com/votca/xtp)
* [Ceiba](https://github.com/nlesc-nano/ceiba)
* [swan](https://github.com/nlesc-nano/swan)
* [flamingo](https://github.com/nlesc-nano/flamingo)

I also maintain these other projects:
* [CI for science](https://github.com/ci-for-research/example-python-monte-carlo-pi)
* [qmflows](https://github.com/SCM-NV/qmflows)
* [nano-qmflows](https://github.com/SCM-NV/nano-qmflows)


## Coding in Rust
🚀 Rust has a special place in my heart. I develop the following Rust projects:
* [A toy eigenvalues solver in Rust](https://github.com/felipeZ/eigenvalues)
* [A web service backend](https://github.com/malvacea/malvaceae) using with tools like [actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web), [async-graphql](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql) and [ndarray](https://docs.rs/ndarray/latest/ndarray/)


## Some cool blogs that I have written
* [Using Rust for scientific numerical applications](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/using-rust-for-scientific-numerical-applications-learning-from-past-experiences-798665d9f9f0)
* [A Quick and Dirty Pytest Cookbook](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/a-quick-and-dirty-pytest-cookbook-58051a2980c3)
* [Building a Web Service to Manage Scientific Simulation Data Using GraphQL](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/building-a-web-service-to-manage-scientific-simulation-data-using-graphql-a0bbf1c3f6e9)
* [A Haskell implementation of the Hartree-Fock method](https://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/issue214.pdf)
