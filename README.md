## About me

My name is Felipe Zapata and I am a curious scientific-minded software engineer with a strong conviction that perseverance, teamwork, and a considerable amount of luck 🍀 are the ingredients behind successful projects. BTW, I happen to have a Ph.D. in computational chemistry, during which I spent most of the time coding things like [Haskell ab initio](https://github.com/felipeZ/Haskell-abinitio).

I am also a polyglot programmer: Python, Rust, C++ and Haskell.

### What do I stand for?
> **I firmly believe that intelligence is just a robust methodology to recursively improve my stupidity**

I have worked quite hard to stand where I am today but this would have not been possible if I had not been in the right place at right moment, supported by a long list of extremely kind people.

I also believe that innovative ideas, like the ones developed by entrepreneurs and scientific researchers, are very difficult to carry out, but these ideas are the ones that have the largest potential payoff for society. Therefore, I work on projects that even though they may not be the most popular or glamorous, give me a long-term satisfaction. 


## Scientific Software
🧬 🔭 🔬 I have contributed to the the following scientific software software:
* [Votca: a library to calculate electronic properties of organic materials](https://github.com/votca/xtp)
* [Ceiba: a web service to manage scientific simulation data](https://github.com/nlesc-nano/ceiba)
* [swan: a Python package to create statistical models to predict molecular properties](https://github.com/nlesc-nano/swan)
* [flamingo: a library to compute and filter molecular properties](https://github.com/nlesc-nano/flamingo)
* [A example to setup CI for science](https://github.com/ci-for-research/example-python-monte-carlo-pi)
* [qmflows: a Python library to build and execute computational chemistry workflows](https://github.com/SCM-NV/qmflows)
* [nano-qmflows: a python library to compute electronic properties for nanomaterials](https://github.com/SCM-NV/nano-qmflows)
